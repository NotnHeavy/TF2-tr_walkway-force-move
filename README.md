# (TF2) tr_walkway force move
Bots in tr_walkway_rc2 (and tr_walkway_fix if you use that one, like me) are forced to move by a moving track. This isn't entirely accurate. This plugin uses `usercmd`, like how a normal player would move, instead. That's it. The code sucks though because I wrote this at 1 AM.

# ConVars
notnheavy_tr_walkway_speed - Set the bot speed. Due to TF2 limitations, this is limited up to 520HU/s.
